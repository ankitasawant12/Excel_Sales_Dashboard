## Overview 
If you like playing around Excel as much as I do, then peek in. When it comes to big data. Excel is a very powerful tool and eases up alot of computation on data. I personally find Excel very handy for Analysis and Dashboarding. First, you have to have good cognititve ability, Second, be creative.

## Important concepts 
1. Basic formulas and functions.
